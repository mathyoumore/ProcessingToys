# Sine Dot  

Sine dot uses an array of dots and a little trigonometry to make pleasing and periodic movement with dots and lines. To make the lines move faster, decrease `speed`. The `colors` array contains all the colors that the dots can be. Other values marked `Safe to change` can be changed easily without breaking the program. Outside of that, you're on your own.  

I've found that having `seed_multiplier` a multiple of `line_offset` lends itself to interesting effects :ghost:
